# Ranu Finance V0

Ranu Finance is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) protocol designed for DeFi use cases on the Solana blockchain. 
It leverages the Solana validator staking program to generate yield while providing capital efficiency through liquid staking.

## Overview

### Current Features (V0)
- **Create Pool:** Open a vault pool with a specified maximum cap for deposits.
- **Deposit:** Wrap Solana into LST. This increases capital efficiency by allowing you to continue generating yield from Solana validator rewards while using the LST in various DeFi applications such as staking or lending.
- **Withdraw:** Only Authority/Protocol can withdraw Solana from the vault pool and stake it with Solana validators to generate yield.

### Future Development (V1)
- **Yield Distribution:** Implement mechanisms for distributing yield generated from staking program.
- **Lending Mechanism and DeFi Integration:** Develop lending features and integrate with other DeFi platforms.
